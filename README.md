The only reason this is public repo is financial.
This is a part of me learning the ropes with all the above technologies, as I am new to the client side programming.

Disclaimer:
- NOT AN EXPERT, JUST PLAYING WITH THESE TECHNOLOGIES.
- Absolutely zero attempts were made to clean the code. 
- The main use of this repo is personal, though some might benefit from it.

You can use this for ideas, but by no means should you use it for production.

The solution contains several approaches based on https://github.com/vuejs-templates, as seen in several root .html files.

The current configuration files match example.ts.

There are several things I needed to configure, for instance: 
- Update the package versions to the latest ones, as of 14-03-2017.
- Many additional tsconfig/webpack.config configurations, following Vue 2/Webpack 2/TS 2 tutorials.
- Vuejs assembly configuration, whether it should include a template compiler or not, depending on your vue-loader usage. 
- VS projects - how to build, how to disable TS, etc, as I am willing to rely on the VSCode rather than get into the somewhat raw support in VS2015.

TODO: 
- source maps are not operational yes, js is shown in webpack.
- stabilization 
- production builds
